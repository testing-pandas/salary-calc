            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>SalaryCalc was created to help workers understand their true earning potential. We believe that everyone
                deserves clear, accurate information about their compensation, whether they're negotiating a new job
                offer, planning their budget, or exploring career opportunities.</p>

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>Our salary calculator instantly converts hourly wages into daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, and annual
                income. We support rates from $10 to $100 per hour, covering a wide range of professions and skill
                levels.</p>
            <p>Each calculation is based on standard working assumptions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>8 hours</strong> per day</li>
                <li><strong>5 days</strong> per week (40 hours)</li>
                <li><strong>52 weeks</strong> per year (2,080 working hours)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can customize these values on each calculator page to match your specific work schedule.</p>
